Download Bank Statement**\n- Login to HBL bank portal\n- Navigate: Statements / Transaction History\n- Select: Previous business day (or since last reconciliation)\n- Download as Excel or PDF\n- Save: CHPL-BANK-.MM-.DD-.YY.xlsx\n\n**2. Open Reconciliation Sheet**\n- Location: TBD (Google Sheets - to be organized)\n- Columns: Date, Type (Debit/Credit), Reference, Description, Amount, ERPNext Match, Status, Notes\n\n**3. Import Bank Transactions**\n- Copy from downloaded statement\n- Paste into reconciliation sheet\n- Sort by date (oldest first)\n\n**4. Match with ERPNext**\n- Open ERPNext: Accounts → Payment Entry → List\n- Filter by same date range\n- For each bank transaction:\n  - Look for matching payment: amount, date (±1-2 days), party name\n  - If found: Note ERPNext number in sheet, mark \"Matched\"\n  - If not found: Mark \"Unmatched\", investigate\n\n**5. Identify Discrepancies**\n- **In bank but not ERPNext:** Could be direct deposits, fees, interest, refunds → Create ERPNext entry\n- **In ERPNext but not bank:** Could be processing, failed, future-dated → Verify with bank, may cancel ERPNext entry\n\n**6. Create Missing ERPNext Entries**\n- For legitimate bank transactions not in ERPNext:\n  - Create payment entry (Type: Receive for credit, Pay for debit)\n  - Match amount, date, description\n  - Assign cost center\n  - Note in remarks: \"From bank rec [date]\"\n\n**7. Calculate Closing Balance**\n- Opening balance + Credits - Debits = Closing balance\n- Compare to bank statement ending balance\n- If mismatch: Review for missing transactions, check date cutoffs\n\n**8. Document and File**\n- Save reconciliation sheet\n- Export as PDF\n- Location: TBD (Google Drive > Finance > Reconciliation > [Year] > [Month])\n\n#### TRANSITIONING TO ERPNEXT\n\n**1. Enable Bank Reconciliation**\n- Go to: Accounts → Bank Reconciliation Tool\n\n**2. Import Bank Statement**\n- Click \"Import Bank Statement\"\n- Upload file (Excel/CSV)\n- Map columns to ERPNext fields\n- Preview and confirm\n\n**3. Auto-Match**\n- ERPNext attempts auto-match (exact amounts, similar dates)\n- Review suggested matches (Green = high confidence, Yellow = possible, Red = unmatched)\n- Accept accurate matches\n\n**4. Manual Matching**\n- For unmatched: Click transaction, search for payment entry\n- If found: Link manually\n- If not found: Create new entry\n\n**5. Submit Reconciliation**\n- Review summary\n- Check: Opening + transactions = closing\n- Submit → All linked entries marked \"Reconciled\"\n- Generate report for filing\n\n#### Decision Points\n**Bank transaction not in ERPNext:**\n- Known (fee/interest/deposit) → Create entry\n- Unknown → Investigate before creating\n- Duplicate → Check if already entered differently\n\n**ERPNext payment not in bank:**\n- Still processing (1-2 day lag) → Mark \"Pending\"\n- Failed → Verify, may need to cancel and redo\n- Future-dated → No action needed yet\n\n#### Common Issues\n**Issue:** Unrecognized bank transaction\n**Solution:** URGENT - Contact bank immediately (could be fraud)\n\n**Issue:** Missing transaction in statement\n**Solution:** Check date range, may be just outside range or still processing\n\n**Issue:** ERPNext \"Paid\" but not in bank\n**Solution:** Payment likely failed - contact bank, cancel ERPNext entry, investigate why\n\n**Issue:** Timing differences (1-2 day lag)\n**Solution:** Normal - mark \"Pending\" and reconcile next day\n\n#### Tools & Access\n- HBL Bank Portal (statement download)\n- ERPNext Accounts module\n- Google Sheets (temporary during transition)\n\n#### Best Practices\n- Daily reconciliation: 15-30 min/day prevents errors from compounding\n- Document everything: Unexplained transactions MUST be investigated\n- Month-end priority: Must be 100% reconciled before closing month\n\n---\n"

Understand Grant Structure (One-Time Setup)\n- For each grant document in ERPNext: Grant name/number, donor, amount, period, budget categories, restrictions\n- Create Project in ERPNext for the grant\n- Set up Budget linked to grant project\n\n#### 2. Identify Grant-Eligible Transactions\n- When processing ANY transaction ask: \"Is this funded by a grant?\"\n- If YES: Determine which grant\n- If NO: Tag as \"General Operations\"\n- Grant-eligible: Salaries (for staff on grant), program supplies, travel for grant activities, training costs, equipment (if approved)\n\n#### 3. Tag Transaction to Grant Project\n- In every ERPNext form (Payment Entry, Expense Claim, Payroll Entry, Purchase Invoice):\n  - Project Field: Select grant project\n  - Cost Center: May be grant-specific or regular\n  - Customer: If grant services specific client/community\n- Example: Interpreter salary for GSMA grant → Project \"GSMA Deaf Education\", Cost Center \"8500-SL&Training\", Note \"50% time on GSMA\"\n\n#### 4. Allocate to Budget Category\n- Each grant has categories (Personnel, Travel, Equipment, Supplies, Other per agreement)\n- Use ERPNext Accounting Dimension or custom field\n- If not available: Use description/remarks\n\n#### 5. Document Justification\n- Add notes in ERPNext: Why charged to grant? What activity? What budget line?\n- Example in remarks: \"Grant: GSMA, Activity: Teacher training workshop, Budget: Travel-Domestic, Justification: Transport for 2 trainers per deliverable 3.2\"\n\n#### 6. Verify Against Budget\n- Before processing: Check ERPNext → Projects → [Grant] → Budget\n- View: Budgeted vs Actual vs Remaining\n- If exceeded: Stop, check if reallocation allowed, get approval, document\n- If not allowed: Cannot charge, use general funds\n\n#### 7. Monthly Utilization Review\n- Generate: Project-wise transactions report\n- Review by budget category: Total spent, remaining, burn rate\n- Share summary with grant manager/Azima and donor if required\n\n#### 8. Quarterly/Annual Reporting\n- Prepare for donors: Budget vs actual by category, narrative on funded activities, supporting docs\n- Export from ERPNext: Financial report, budget utilization\n- Format per donor requirements, submit by deadline\n\n#### 9. Audit Trail Maintenance\n- Keep: Transaction records, receipts, timesheets, approvals, reports submitted\n- Location: TBD (Google Drive > Finance > Grants > [Grant Name])\n- Retention: Per grant (usually 5-7 years post-grant)\n\n#### Decision Points\n**Transaction applies to multiple grants:** Determine primary or split proportionally (60% Grant A, 40% Grant B), document split ratio\n**Budget category overspent but surplus elsewhere:** Check if reallocation allowed, if YES get donor approval and document, if NO use general funds\n**Unsure if eligible:** Review grant agreement, consult grant manager, if doubt charge to general (safer for audit)\n\n#### Common Issues\n**Issue:** Forgot to tag transaction\n**Solution:** Amend in ERPNext, add project/grant tag, resubmit ASAP\n\n**Issue:** Tagged to wrong grant\n**Solution:** Amend, change to correct grant, document correction\n\n**Issue:** Grant budget exhausted mid-project\n**Solution:** Review spending, request reallocation if possible, escalate for additional funding or scope reduction\n\n**Issue:** Donor rejects expense in audit\n**Solution:** Move from grant to general funds retroactively, update reports, learn for future\n\n**Issue:** Multiple staff partially on grant\n**Solution:** Use timesheets for % of time, allocate proportionally (30% time = 30% of salary to grant)\n\n#### Tools & Access\n- ERPNext (Projects, Budget, Accounts)\n- Google Drive (grant documentation)\n- Grant agreements\n\n#### Key Notes\n- Tag EVERY transaction (missing tags = inaccurate reports = donor issues)\n- Budget monitoring continuous (don't wait for month-end)\n- Documentation CRITICAL (audits can happen years later)\n- When in doubt, ask (better to clarify than mis-charge)\n\n---\n"
